* If I put a user in the Include/Exclude list, and they're not found (invalid name or just not currently streaming), should they persist in that list? 
    * Yes: It lets you make one consistent bookmark or favorites set
    * No: That's extra clutter

* Should there be some client-side filtering when search options change, where possible??
    * Yes: If I get 100 streams and decide I don't want to see a certain game in there, there's no need to re-call the server, just immediately hide it
    * No: This can have some inconsistencies, and may not have all the latest data. 
        * This can also cause too many visual changes
    * Possible solution: Have a button specifically for local filtering
